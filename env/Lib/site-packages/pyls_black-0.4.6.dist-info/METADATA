> [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) plugin for the [Python Language Server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server).

In the same `virtualenv` as `python-language-server`:

```shell
pip3 install pyls-black
```

To avoid unexpected results you should make sure `yapf` and `autopep8` are not installed.

* `pyls-black` can either format an entire file or just the selected text.
* The code will only be formatted if it is syntactically valid Python.
* Text selections are treated as if they were a separate Python file.
  Unfortunately this means you can't format an indented block of code.
* `pyls-black` will use your project's [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ambv/black#pyprojecttoml) if it has one.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/rupert/pyls-black/wiki) for instructions on how to use `pyls-black` with popular text editors.
